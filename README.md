# BlindEyes
_Created for MR Dev Days 2022 - Microsoft Hackathon_

Humans are born with 5 senses: smell, taste, touch, hearing, and sight. However, over many millennia, humans interacting with the environment around them have lost one or more of their senses. Sensory impairment has been an issue in history; specifically, the history of blindness has not been as well documented as other disabililties. Early glasses can be dated back to the 13th century in Italy, but notable visually impaired figures such as Hellen Keller and Louis Braille only date as far back as the 19th century. Though lacking visual prowess, such people have improved versions of the other four senses. 

So, what if we were to see with another one of our senses, specifically sound?

BlindEyes is a way for the visually impaired to better see objects in their vicinity through enhanced sound. More instructions such as download instructions and usage instructions are to follow as the project progresses!

Built for **HoloLens 2** using the preview release of **MRTK3**
